## Dependencies & Constraints

### Tech Constraints

- TypeScript strict mode (no `any`)
- All dependencies must be published npm packages

### Business Constraints
- Vietnamese market focus (localization priority)
- SEO-first approach (every page must be discoverable)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- GDPR/privacy compliance for EU users

### V1 Schema Alignment (Migration Reference)

### V1-V2 Database Schema Mapping

**Current Implementation (Phase 1-2):**

| V1 Table | V2 Reference | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `property_type` | Drizzle schema ✅ | Complete | Property classification (apartment, house, villa, etc.) |
| `folder` | Drizzle schema ✅ | Complete | News category hierarchy (parent-child structure) |
| `auth_user` | PostgreSQL native | Complete | User authentication (Web2py auth system) |
| `auth_group` | PostgreSQL native | Complete | User roles (admin, agent, guest) |

**Planned Implementation (Phase 3-5):**

| V1 Table | V2 Target | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `real_estate` | Phase 3 | Planned | Property listings (40+ fields per listing) |
| `real_estate_transaction` | Phase 3 | Planned | Sales/rental transactions (status workflow) |
| `transaction_history` | Phase 3 | Planned | Immutable audit log (state changes) |
| `project` | Phase 3 | Planned | Real estate projects (development phases) |
| `consultation` | Phase 4 | Planned | Lead inquiries (salesman assignments) |
| `locations` | Phase 3 | Planned | Geographic hierarchy (city→district→ward) |
| `post_office` | Phase 5 | Planned | Office hierarchy (5-level org structure) |
| `office_staff` | Phase 5 | Planned | Employee roster (multi-office support) |
| `dbank_account` | Phase 4 | Planned | Bank accounts (commission management) |
| `withdraw` | Phase 4 | Planned | Withdrawal workflow (pending→approved→completed) |

### Key V1 Patterns to Adopt

**1. Soft-Delete Convention:**
```typescript
// NEVER: DELETE FROM real_estate WHERE id = ...
// ALWAYS: UPDATE real_estate SET aactive=false WHERE id = ...
// QUERY: WHERE aactive=true (mandatory filter)
```

**2. Status Enum Pattern:**
```typescript
const PROPERTY_STATUS = { DRAFT: 1, ACTIVE: 2, SOLD: 3, RENTED: 4, INACTIVE: 5 };
const TX_STATUS = { PENDING: 1, APPROVED: 2, REJECTED: 3, IN_RECONCILIATION: 4, COMPLETED: 5 };
```

**3. Audit Trail Fields:**
```typescript
// All transactional tables include:
created_on: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
created_by: FK to auth_user (NOT NULL)
updated_on: TIMESTAMP (auto-updated by PostgreSQL trigger)
```

**4. Hierarchical Data:**
```typescript
// Self-referencing parent_id for trees:
parent_id: FK to self (NULL for root)
// Example: news folders, office hierarchy, property type groups
```

**5. Commission & Financial:**
```typescript
// V1 pattern for commission workflow:
// Transaction (completed) → Commission accrual → Withdrawal request → Payment
// Fields: rate_seller, amount_seller, bonus, commission_percentage
```

### Migration Risk Mitigation

**Known Issues from V1:**
- 57 tables with many unused/legacy fields → cleanup plan needed
- Salesman/Staff dual identity system → consolidation roadmap
- SEO metadata uses generic entity_type/entity_id → consider specialized schema
- Real estate has 40+ fields with flexible JSON data → validation strategy

**Recommendations:**
1. Phase 3: Create clean `real_estate` schema mapping only needed V1 fields
2. Phase 4: Implement data validation layer (JSON schema for flexible fields)
3. Phase 5: Plan data cleanup (archive legacy tables, consolidate identities)
4. Ongoing: Document breaking changes for V1 API consumers

## Known Limitations
- Mock data only (no real property API yet)
- No user authentication
- No transaction/booking capability
- No real-time updates

- Property/project/news cards render correctly on mobile/desktop
